# Predicting-Airbnb-Rental-Price

In this project, five predictive models have been used to predict the price of a rental in Airbnb. Linear regression model was the first model that has been used and it came with a relatively high rmse. The second model that I have tried was the Decision Tree model and the rmse was a little bit lower than linear regression model. Moreover, the third model I used was regular boosting model gbm model with a lower RMSE than last two model. Then, xgboost model is the fourth model I have used, resulting in higher RMSE, but a lower score in Kaggle. Last but not least, the Random Forest Model is the last model I have tried, and the rmse was a little bit lower than xgboost model, but a lowest score in Kaggle.
